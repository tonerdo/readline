# ReadLine

ReadLine is a [GNU Readline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Readline) like library built in pure C#. It can serve as a drop in replacement for the inbuilt `Console.ReadLine()` and brings along
with it some of the terminal goodness you get from unix shells, like command history navigation and tab auto completion.

It is cross platform and runs anywhere .NET is supported, targeting `netstandard1.3` means that it can be used with .NET Core as well as the full .NET Framework.

## Usage

### Add ReadLine as a dependency

```json
"dependencies": {
    "ReadLine": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Read input from the console

```csharp
string input = ReadLine.Read("(prompt)> ");
```

_Note: The `(prompt>)` is  optional_

### History management

```csharp
// Get command history
ReadLine.GetHistory();

// Add command to history
ReadLine.AddHistory("dotnet run");

// Clear history
ReadLine.ClearHistory();
```

_Note: History information is persisted for an entire application session. Also, calls to `ReadLine.Read()` automatically adds the console input to history_

### Auto-Completion

```csharp
// t:string - The current text entered in the console
// s:int - The index of the command fragment that needs to be completed
ReadLine.AutoCompletionHandler = (t, s) =>
{
    var suggestions = /* logic to generate suggestions */;
    // return string array of suggestions 
    // or null if no suggestions are available
    return suggestions;
};
```

_Note: If no "AutoCompletionHandler" is set, tab autocompletion will be disabled_
